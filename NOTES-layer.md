# NOTES-layer (long log, newest at bottom)

## Session 1 (2026-10-25 19:17Z-)
- submit 53d9d188 @224f7fd (baseline modules): 1.0005x [0.985, 1.016], 22,608.9 us; 13/13. First board row.
- check 7e3e63a1 @367fbbf (baseline + ~/attn kernels): FAILED tests 4 and 8: `Unsupported function referenced:
  next_power_of_2` in _attn_body's PF path (full layers): SGLang's import leaves triton.next_power_of_2 a plain function.
  Fixed in build.py with our own triton.runtime.jit.constexpr_function.
- v2 (2a21d76): own glue. H100 microbench (graph, cold L2): one tiny kernel 2.4 us; boundary T=1 5.8, T=256 11.1;
  router: cuBLAS FP32 F.linear T=1 8.1 / T=8 23.6 (!), Triton FMA split-K BT=next_pow2(T) BE 2 BK 1024 KS 8: 5.9 / 11.0;
  hi/lo tl.dot T=16..256: 7.2-12.1; routing kernel 5.5; pre-expert norm 3.7.
  FMA router with BT=8 at T=1 was 25 us (3-D broadcast product wastes 8x): size BT to T.
