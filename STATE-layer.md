Same code checked 2.0731x (19163546): whole-run noise ~+-1.5%. Older: 19ebde23 v108 2.0860x. Lead 09:28Z rule: <= 2 'within 1% + per-shape evidence' submits/day (1 used 10-27).
night5 s19: no build, 0 runs; proj KQ K-split = -0.3 us vs the twf_split 66 we already tune (not ported). NOTES n5s19.
night5 s18: check 3e39a051 (v162, unchanged main) **2.1143x**, prepare_s 88.9: abs us beat the board run v153 on 9/12 shapes
  (d32 sl 149.7 vs 155.7, d32 full 301.2 vs 308.2, v32 sl 327.8 vs 335.7, d16 sl 124.0 vs 129.9) but SGLang drew fast (ratio is per run).
  Not submitted. Re-checked: T=256 boundary writes no h32 (~24 MB/call = near floor); T=256 unpool/FR are ~compute-bound (cuBLAS).
  10-28: 7 checks / 8 submits (09:28Z-rule submits of 10-28 used).
night5 s17: **main = v162** = v160 + attn RF_TRIG_ALL (batched _red_fin triggers after its wait) + CB_TRIG (_combine triggers after
  its wait): the o GEMM's W ring now fills under the merge at d16/d32/v1 full (H100 -0.2..-0.8 us) + T=8 full base g30n:o (H200 tuner
  picked it once CB_TRIG was in). check 8f5427dc (v161) 2.1169x, prepare_s 88.8; v16 sl 262.6 confirms v160 (2 H200 samples ~261 vs

night5 s13: no build (all layer levers on record measured/bounded; NOTES n5s13). Lead's scored run of v157 = 35af5031
  **2.1420x** (prepare_s 100.6): board best unchanged. 10-28 budget: 11 checks / 8 submits. Lane request posted in COORD.
night5 s12: **main = v157** (83bc412) = v156 + TSHIM (g30 x8 + lt libs built torch-header-free: a lib's ~50 CPU-s was torch

  (v156 182.0): ~128 s of headroom under the 220 s cap for new builds/TUNE options. H100 12-shape A/B tie; SASS identical.
  10-28 budget after it: 11 checks / 9 submits. Other libs still pay ~45 CPU-s headers each (NOTES n5s12) if builds grow again.
night5 s11: **main = v156** (50355f2) = v155 + nvcc --split-compile=0 on moe/g10 libs + build pool 16 + 4 dead g30 builds dropped
  (local cold 142 -> 131.5 s; H100 12-shape A/B tie). check 0e4ba3c2 2.1421x, **judge prepare_s 182.0** (no gain on the judge's
  build host). 10-28 budget after it: 12 checks / 9 submits. No new layer lever found (NOTES n5s11).
night5 s10: **main = v155** = v153 + T=8 sl base g30n:o, T=8 full g14alt 3, T=32 base g30kgx:pooler, TUNE lists cut to the H200

## Per-load H200 us vs the s12 floor (board run 19ebde23 = v108; lead 05:07Z request; s74)
Score %/us = gain in total score per us saved on that layer type (geomean of 6 loads x (46 sl + 16 full)).
| load | sliding us / floor / gap | %/us sl | full us / floor / gap | %/us full | gap x weight (sl + full) |
| d1  |  67.7 /  40 /  27.7 | 0.177 |  75.8 /  44 /  31.8 | 0.062 | 4.9 + 2.0 % |
| d16 | 127.9 /  77 /  50.9 | 0.083 | 208.9 / 137 /  71.9 | 0.029 | 4.2 + 2.1 % |
| d32 | 173.3 /  85 /  88.3 | 0.058 | 326.8 / 208 / 118.8 | 0.020 | 5.1 + 2.4 % |
| v1  | 106.8 /  62 /  44.8 | 0.112 | 121.8 /  66 /  55.8 | 0.039 | 5.0 + 2.2 % |

Biggest H200 items (check c755dcc3 profiles): experts = 29-53% of every load (tk2f d1 20-28, d16 62-79, d32 70-103,
v1 54-64; twq/twm+hot v16 169-186, v32 217+114 us); full attention _gd_full d16 87.5 / d32 167.6 (at its ~4.0 TB/s gather
floor per ~/attn STATE); g24 pooler+unpool d16 35, d32 48; pr1 17.3 (d1). Layer glue (bnd, routing, norms) <= ~10%.
Judge noise: one shape moves up to 10% between runs of the same code (v108: d32 full 291 vs 327 us).

## NEXT (n5s8)
0. RULE (n5s8): routing-sensitive expert knobs (hot, twf_split, twq, bkt, bal, tk2h) are decided on real-input H100 A/Bs over
   >= 3 seeds (tools/ab_flag.py, SEEDS=99,7,13, variants with TUNE = {}) and pinned in TUNE_BASE; the H200 tuner's synthetic
   routing (SYNTH_P) does not represent the judge's inputs for them. Candidate: same sweep for T=8 / T=1 expert knobs (tk2f*).
Plateau: every kernel-level lever in NOTES s45-n5s7 is measured or bounded (dead-ends below + NOTES). H200 judge noise
(+-1.5% total; the tuner's own T=16 sl default moved 162 -> 180 us between nodes) hides < 2% changes: decide on H100
interleaved A/Bs (tools/ab_flag.py), confirm on a check. Submit only > 2.1339x, or per the 09:28Z rule (>= 2.1126x +
per-shape evidence). Open items, biggest first (none started):
1. o+bnd+pr1 megakernel at T=1 (bound ~-3 us d1 = ~+0.5%; NOTES s45/s61/s74; moe n5s9 audit: post-attention chain <= 3-4.5 us).
1b. DONE n5s16/n5s17 (v160, v161): no serial PDL hand-off left (timeline_all audit, NOTES n5s17).
2. Any new Handoff from moe (attention lane) / proj: port as a TUNE option, validate, bundle into one check.
T=16: every g30 option ties on 3 H200 checks (f824b925, 133068b8, 4937830f): don't add more g30 work at T=16.

## Board
- Best scored = see top (19ebde23 v108 2.0860x). Older bests: 703d3a7e v70 1.9954x, 371a17ee v42 1.9558x (NOTES s32/s27).
- Judge noise: SGLang's own per-shape times move 2-6% between runs; identical code's per-shape ratios spread ~+-1.5%,
  total ~+-1%: one check cannot resolve <2% changes. Decide on H100 interleaved A/Bs (tools/ab_flag.py), check to confirm.
- SGLang per shape (H200 us sliding/full): d1 171/183, d16 262-271/431-444, d32 261-268/614-634, v1 259-261/271-280,
  v16 523-537/700, v32 699-745/1049-1116.
- Scoring: geomean over 6 loads, each = 46 sliding + 16 full layers: 1 us on d1 sliding = +0.16% total, v1 +0.10%,
  d16 +0.07%, d32 +0.05%, v16 +0.04%, v32 +0.03%.
- Floors (us): d1 40/44, d16 77/137, d32 85/208, v1 62/66, v16 127/189, v32 144/267.
- Routing robustness: tools/route_judge.py 0/900 (s9). Output robustness: tools/replay_test.py (s10, 0/90 + 0/60).

## Code (muse_decode_layer/)
- `layer.py` = the layer. Inlined by **`python build.py` -> submission.py** (never edit submission.py by hand):
  `attn_src.py` = ~/attn submission.py @82866c6 (kernel_fn -> attn_kernel_fn, constexpr np2 fix, csl::decode patched
  to trigger PDL dependents); `moe_src.py` = r-moe 499bde6 (TK2F 204 at T=1, TK2F_DYN 84204 + moe_norm3 at T>1; tk2f trigger text-patched by TK2F_LATE_TRIG; T<=32 = moe_tk2f one launch; names prefixed `_moe_`; T>32 = its kernel_fn (moe_twf: gemm13+gemm2 in one persistent launch); layer.py patches moe_norm2 to
  trigger dependents); `g10_src.cu` = proj gemv10 (r-proj d894f4e, m=1), `g12_src.cu` = proj gemv12 (r-proj e71d015,
  m=8), `g13_src.cu`/`g14_src.cu` = proj gemv13 (m=1)/gemv14 (m=8) over lossless 12-bit BF16 (r-proj 3f173eb, bit-exact escape headers; packs `_pack13/_pack14` in `_g12_prepare`, used for qkv+pooler (G13_CFG/G14_CFG) when the weight compresses, built in `_g10_lib`), `lt_src.cu` = proj cuBLASLt explicit-algo GEMM (LT_CFG fixed H200 picks, `_lt_prepare`); layer.py `_g10_lib` builds g10/g12 in one load_inline and text-patches them (PDL trigger, PDL-secondary launch).
  Re-copy: `git -C ~/r-moe show <c>:muse_moe_w4a16/submission.py > moe_src.py` (check the 68-int route meta
  matches `_moe_bucket`, and that the patch anchors in layer.py/build.py still match: asserts fire at import).
- Router: T=1 `_router_fma` (Triton FP32), T=8 `r3_router` (CUDA FP32, in `_g10_lib`), T=128 proj `pj_router3` (`pr3_src.cu`,
  PR3_CFG; hi/lo one kernel, atomics), other T>8 `_router_split` (SGLang hi/lo BF16).
- KV_PF (T=1 sliding): `_linear(..., kv_pf=)` passes page_table[0, -2049:], k/v cache to the text-patched g13 (`_g10_lib`).
- gemv19 (s10): `g19_src.cu` (proj dev/gemv19.cu @6996d0c, built in `_g10_lib` with G19_ONLY2), `_pack19`,
  `_g19_prepare` (packs + per-pick F.linear check), `_g19(x, key, state)` -> FP32 [T, n] or None. G19_CFG (key, T),
  G19_ON, G19_GRID (pooler 108 blocks at T=16: leaves SMs for the side-stream router), BOUNDARY_TRIG. EPOCH COUNTER:
  one per (pick, grid size) (`e[3]` dict): a counter shared across grid sizes deadlocks.
- Pipeline: qkv `_linear` (gemv10 T=1, gemv12 T=8, cuBLASLt pick at T=128/256, else cuBLAS) -> attn -> o `_linear` -> `_boundary` -> side stream:
  router + `_routing` || pooler `_linear` -> `_rmsnorm_gain` -> experts (`_moe_kernel_fn`: tk2 at T<=32, route+gather+
  moe_tw at T>32) -> unpool `_linear` (1024-row slice at T<=8; gemv17 `_G17_SRC` at T=1/8) -> `_boundary`.
  T=1: experts = moe_tk2f launched by the layer (`_experts_n2u`) + `n2u` (moe_norm2 fused into the unpool GEMV, `_N2U_SRC`).
  T=16/32: pooler = 2-slab split-K bmm FP32 out (POOLER_BMM), slabs summed in `_rmsnorm_gain` (NS/SS).
  PDL: GEMV_PDL (gemv triggers; glue after it launches with PDL at T in PDL_TOKENS) and GEMV_PDL_SECONDARY
  {(tokens, sliding): keys} = GEMVs launched as PDL secondaries.
- bench.py `test` / `bench [file] [filter]` / `prof`; tools/timeline.py <file> "<load> <layer>" (per-kernel
  start/end of one replay); tools/ckparse.py <check.json> (per-shape table). variants/ (gitignored) builds for A/B
  (sub_v15/v16 ...): regenerate from git. Flags kept OFF (dead, s5): TW_TOKENS, TK2_PDL13/2, ROUTER_AFTER_POOLER,
  POOLER_HI_PRIORITY, ROUTER_L2_PF_TOKENS.

Older ranked-next list (s3-s64 items, all closed): NOTES-layer.md and the dead ends below.

## Dead ends (details in NOTES)
- s75: moe n21 twq K-split at T=128 (moe-only H200 -10.6 us) loses in-layer on H200 (+6 us sl real, +11..16 tuner).
- s74: PR1_BND (boundary fused into pr1 at T=1) H100 +1.3..1.8, H200 tuner +0.6..1.4 us; BND_SPLIT 1/2/4/8 per T: noise on both.
- s72: QSS (2-slab split-K qkv bmm, slabs summed at load) at verify sliding T=128/256 (nvs FP32 loads +1.6 us; H200 tie);
  moe_norm2 -> unpool prologue fusion (oracle: norm2 is free, it hosts the unpool's PDL window).
- s62: csl PW at d1 (+1.3..1.7 us: csl CTAs crowd g13 / lose KV_PF's warm rows); g19 full smem carveout so csl co-resides
  with the d16 qkv (csl starts at 2.8 us but its gathers slow g19 17.3 -> 20.6: net +0.3..0.6; kept as TUNE cslcarve).
- s61: nds at d16 sliding (+4..4.6 us); pooler W L2 prefetch at T=16/32 (g19 consumer-bound, warm L2 no faster); qkv T=16/32 at
  H100 cold-stream floor; T=1 pr1 SMEM preload bounded ~-3 us (needs o+bnd+pr1 megakernel; not started).
- s60: pr3 router at T=32 beside g19 pooler (+1.5..2.7 us in layer); pooler grid 108/120/132 all equal standalone (g19-bound).
- s15: n2u8 (T=8 norm3+unpool on clusters), bndc (cluster boundary), CUDA 1-CTA boundary, BND_ROWS, UPF3 (unpool
  W L2 prefetch at tk2f end / in norm; H200 diag b1ee542c d32 -4%), G10_PFL2 (o W prefetch during csl), pr1 npf 6-12,
  qkv/o g19 at T=32 (8 rounds H100 +2.6..3.4), qkv g19 at T=8 (m=8 unsupported). Patches: dev/n2u8_s15.patch, dev/bndc_s15.patch.
- s14: UPF2 (tk2f finishers L2-prefetch the unpool slice), N2U_BOUNDARY (still +2.8), BND_SPIN (flag-spin boundary:
  +2 us, race), g17 8/16 rows per block. RULE: no __ldg/.nc on producer data after griddepcontrol.wait (hoisted
  above it); register loads "before the wait" get sunk below it: use cp.async.bulk.prefetch.L2 / LDGSTS; check SASS.
- s12: XN (pre-expert rmsnorm inside tk2f: +0.2..0.7 us as its own instantiation; in the shared one it slowed
  d16/d32 by 1-2 us), UPF (tk2f L2-prefetches the unpool slice: tie). A/B kernel edits against the original binary.
- s10: g19 at T=32 (H200: proj diag + check 5cf5247d); g19 pooler on all 132 SMs (router starved, +4 us H100); router3
  at T=16/32 beside g19 (tie); o g19 at T=16 (H100 tie); d1 g13 pooler on fewer blocks (+0.7..1.1 us).
- s9: router3 at T=16/32 (+1..3 H100, crowds the pooler bmm); ROUTER_L2_PF (1,)/(8,) (noise); T=8 pooler g14 on 64
  fat blocks (+2..6); KV_PF at v1 (vtk barely gains from warm KV).
- s8: boundary as n2u's last-block epilogue (+2.7); n2u PDL after tk2f (+2..3); moe_norm2 PDL after tk2f (g_pdl 6:
  +1.1..1.4); bmm split-K for o/unpool at T=16/32 (+0.3..0.6); pooler bmm at T=128/256 (noise). RACE: gemv17 PDL
  secondary of norm2 at T=8 fails test 8 on repeats (unexplained; off).
- s7: fused pooler+router GEMM with cuBLAS heuristics (tie, kept as FUSED_ROUTER_TOKENS=()).
- s6: moe twf at decode T=16/32 (+22/+25 us H100); L2 prefetch of the unpool W from twf CTAs at their work-counter
  exhaustion (PF 16-40 MB: +1..5 us); gemv14 for o (verify full) and unpool slice at T=8 (+0.6..1.5 us).
- s5: moe_tw at decode T=16/32 (+14/+29 us); Triton split-K skinny GEMM (ties cuBLAS); tk2 gemm13 as PDL secondary
  of rmsnorm (tie); pooler-first / priority-stream pooler at T=8 (router starves: +2-3); router W L2 prefetch (T=8
  router is issue-bound); tl.dot FP32 router; cuBLASLt pooler m256 in the layer (+11.5 beside the router); pooler
  m16/m32 lt picks (judge noise). Race lesson: allocate side-stream-written tensors before freeing main temporaries.
- s4: router on few fat CTAs + pooler on the remaining SMs (HBM-bound together: tie); _red_fin PDL trigger (+2.5 us
  d1 full); gemv12 PDL secondary for unpool at T=8 (tie) and for o on verify-full layers (+1.3).
- s3: proj gemv7 as layer GEMVs (ties cuBLAS m1, loses m2-8); pooler before router fork; router grid sweeps (noise);
  L2 bulk prefetch inside boundary CTAs (-0.7 us) or concurrent on a side stream (+3 us); moe_big config sweep.
- Multi-CTA boundary (atomics + spin barrier); one-pass boundary (4 sums): both slower.
- PDL on glue after cuBLAS: no gain (cuBLAS never triggers; after our gemv10/12 it does gain, v12). Side-stream moe bucketing at T>=128: +29..67 us on the judge.
- L2 prefetch of the next weight on a side stream (load kernel or cp.async.bulk.prefetch.L2): GEMM speeds up but
  attention is delayed/slowed by the same amount; a side-stream fork at graph START costs ~9 us.
- GEMV with PDL preloading W before griddepcontrol.wait AFTER A BIG PRODUCER (s2: Triton o GEMV after attention): zero-sum. After small producers (norm2, csl at d1) it wins (v12-v14).
- torch.mm(out_dtype=float32) instead of F.linear: same speed.
